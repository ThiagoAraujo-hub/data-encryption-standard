# DES and 3DES

## 1. DES

Data Encryption Standard (DES) is one of the earliest encryption methods and is considered a basic protection with a small key size of approximately 56 bits. Its algorithm is the most widely used worldwide and performs 16 rounds of encoding to secure information.

The complexity and size of encryption keys are measured in bits. When encryption is done with 128 bits, it means that \(2^{128}\) is the number of possible keys to decrypt it. Currently, this number of bits is considered secure, but the higher the number, the greater the security.

## 2. 3DES

Triple DES was originally developed to replace DES, as hackers learned to break it with relative ease. At one time, 3DES was the recommended standard for security.

This encryption is named for its use of three 56-bit keys, resulting in a total key size of 168 bits. Experts in the field argue that a 112-bit key is sufficient to protect data.
